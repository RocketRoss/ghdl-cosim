C interface

**********************************************

This example is a reference and a test suite for the helper C headers provided in :cosimtree:`vhpidirect`. These headers are a reference of GHDL's ABI, and can be imported to easily convert non-trivial data types between C and VHDL. However, the ABI is not settled, so it might change without prior notice.
